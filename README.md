# 📦 Data Structures

Welcome to the **Data Structures** repository! This project provides clean, well-documented implementations of fundamental data structures in [e.g., Python/C++/Java]. It's perfect for computer science students, coding interview prep, or anyone looking to build a strong foundation in data structures.

## 🚀 What's Inside

This repository includes:

| Data Structure      | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Arrays**          | Static and dynamic arrays, operations like insert, delete, search |
| **Linked Lists**    | Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists |
| **Stacks**          | Array-based and linked-list-based stack implementations |
| **Queues**          | Standard queues, circular queues, and double-ended queues (Deque) |
| **Hash Tables**     | Custom hash functions, collision handling (chaining & open addressing) |
| **Trees**           | Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees |
| **Heaps**           | Min-heaps, max-heaps, priority queues |
| **Tries**           | Prefix trees, autocomplete functionality |
| **Graphs**          | Representations (adjacency list/matrix), BFS, DFS, shortest paths |
| **Disjoint Sets**   | Union-Find with path compression and union by rank |
